## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston College. My research interests are in **Industrial Organization** and **Applied Econometrics**. My work focuses on the identification of structural models and their applications to policy questions, with a particular focus on demand analysis.

For the 2024-2025 academic year, I will be a postdoc researcher at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). I will join the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025.
