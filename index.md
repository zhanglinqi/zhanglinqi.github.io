## About

My research interests are in **Industrial Organization** and **Applied Econometrics**. My work focuses on the identification of structural models and their applications to policy questions, with a particular focus on demand analysis.

For the 2024-2025 academic year, I will be a postdoc researcher at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). I will join the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2025. I obtained my Ph.D. from Boston College.
