## About

I am an Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School. 

My research interests are in **Empirical Industrial Organization** and **Applied Econometrics**. My work focuses on the identification of structural models and their applications to policy questions, with a particular focus on demand analysis.

I obtained my Ph.D. from Boston College. I worked as a postdoc researcher at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) for the 2024-2025 academic year.
